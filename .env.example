# Optional: useful when deploying behind HTTPS domain
# DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=example.com,www.example.com

# =========================
# Teams (Django subapps)
# =========================
# Which Django apps are enabled in this runtime.
# In DEV for a single team: TEAM_APPS=team1
# In Integration: TEAM_APPS=team1,team2,team3,...
TEAM_APPS=team1,team2,team3,team4,team5,team6,team7,team8,team9,team10,team11,team12,team13

JWT_SECRET=change-me-too
JWT_ACCESS_TTL_SECONDS=900
JWT_REFRESH_TTL_SECONDS=604800

# Cookie security:
# - local dev: False
# - production behind HTTPS: True
JWT_COOKIE_SECURE=False

# SameSite:
# - Lax is good default when everything is on same site/origin (recommended).
# - None is only needed for true cross-site usage (requires Secure=True).
JWT_COOKIE_SAMESITE=Lax

# Optional: if you ever need to share cookies across subdomains (e.g. *.example.com)
# JWT_COOKIE_DOMAIN=.example.com

# =========================
# CORS / CSRF (Dev fallback)
# =========================
# If you use the "allow any localhost port in DEBUG" regex approach,
# you can leave CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS empty.
# If you later want strict allowlist:
# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=

# If you deploy behind HTTPS and hit CSRF issues for POSTs from a browser:
# CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://example.com,https://www.example.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=

# =========================
# Default Database (Core)
# =========================
# Core Django DB. In dev this is SQLite (disposable).
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
# DATABASE_URL=mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME

# =========================
# Optional: Per-team databases (ONLY if you choose multi-DB per app)
# =========================
# If you adopt the per-team DB-alias approach:
# - Each team app gets its own DB alias named exactly like the app: team1, team2, ...
# - Router sends teamX models to DATABASES["teamX"]
#
# Teams can set their own URL for local sqlite or cloud mysql.
# In dev (single team): you would typically enable only one TEAM_APPS entry and set only its URL.

# TEAM1_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./team1.sqlite3
# TEAM2_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./team2.sqlite3

# Cloud MySQL examples (per team credentials):
# TEAM1_DATABASE_URL=mysql://team1_user:team1_pass@HOST:PORT/DBNAME
# TEAM2_DATABASE_URL=mysql://team2_user:team2_pass@HOST:PORT/DBNAME
